# Starbucks Data Science Capstone Project
Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Nitin Ramchand Lalwani

## Introduction
This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.

Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.

Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.

## Data sets

The data is contained in three files:

portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json - demographic data for each customer
transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:

portfolio.json

id (string) - offer id
offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational
difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer
reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer
duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days
channels (list of strings)
profile.json

age (int) - age of the customer
became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account
gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)
id (str) - customer id
income (float) - customer's income
transcript.json

event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)
person (str) - customer id
time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0
value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record

## Project Motivation

1) What are the main features that helps us identify whether an offer will be completed or not
2) Define a predictive model that will define when a customer will complete an offer with the data given, which is customer data, sociodemographic data and transaction data.

## Results

For question 1)
The main two features are the ones that are engineered in the project, which are the total amount spent by a customer before a transaction and the customer loyalty in days
For question 2) 
A Random Forest Classifier is the algorithm that has the highest f1_score of 0.848 in the training dataset and a f1 score of 0.849 for the validation data set which is 30% of the data.
